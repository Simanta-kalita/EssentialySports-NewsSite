              "\n <p><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nintendo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo</a> has always ruled the handheld gaming console industry for a long time. However, Asus might be planning to challenge the title battle with its ROG Ally handheld console release. The new Asus ROG Ally&#8217;s future is looking very promising; furthermore, it may even overshadow its competitors Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.</p> <p>The Asus ROG Ally has already shocked the handheld console industry to its core with its unbelievable specs. Indeed, Asus has drawn several players&#8217; attention and could be a serious competitor for Nintendo in the future. Interestingly, Steam Deck has also congratulated Asus for ROG Ally&#8217;s release and promised to look forward to its revolutionary performance.</p> <h2>The Steam Deck praises the new threat to the handheld console industry for the Asus ROG Ally release</h2> <p>The much anticipated handheld gaming device from Asus, the Asus ROG Ally, has officially been revealed. ROG Ally brings a 7-inch IPS LCD display with FHD resolution, a 16:9 aspect ratio, and a 120Hz refresh rate. It will be running on Windows 11, the ROG Ally will also offer three months of free Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p> <p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1739539 aligncenter\" src=\"https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1081\" srcset=\"https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1.jpg 1920w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-560x315.jpg 560w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-266x150.jpg 266w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-370x208.jpg 370w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-800x450.jpg 800w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-20x11.jpg 20w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-185x104.jpg 185w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-740x417.jpg 740w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-400x225.jpg 400w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-1600x901.jpg 1600w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-150x84.jpg 150w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC00752-1-85x48.jpg 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p> <p>Not to mention, it will also be compatible with third-party game clients such as Steam and Epic Games. While the Asus ROG Ally will be competing against <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/nintendo-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a> and the Steam Deck, its full-fledged Windows 11 PC scaled down to the handheld form factor. The AMD Zen4 device comes as a direct challenger to Valve’s Steam Deck, offering an impressive package for gaming.</p> <p><strong>DIVE DEEPER: <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/esports-news-what-a-glorious-time-to-be-alive-fans-welcome-the-launch-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“What a Glorious Time to Be Alive”- Fans Welcome the Launch of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></strong></p> <p>While fans are still comprehending the Asus ROG Ally&#8217;s crazy specs, Nintendo and the Steam Deck&#8217;s future might be in deep trouble. Regardless, the Steam Deck has shared a positive response to Asus ROG Ally&#8217;s launch announcement. Moreover, we saw a healthy relationship sign between the two competitors.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thank you!! We&#39;re big fans of Valve, and love that the openness of the PC platform allows gamers to bring their Steam libraries to devices like the Ally. <br />Here&#39;s to the next chapter of handheld gaming!</p> <p>&mdash; ROG Global (@ASUS_ROG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROG/status/1656842476127387648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 12, 2023</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p> <p>Interestingly, we saw a very wholesome interaction between the two handheld console industry competitors on Twitter. Furthermore, Steam Deck is not the only handheld console that may face severe consequences with the ROG Ally launch. Despite being released for six long years, the Nintendo President s<a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/esports-news-nintendo-president-voices-an-interesting-take-on-nintendos-next-generation-console/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hoots down all the rumors about the next-gen Switch</a> console in development.</p> <p>This indeed helps Asus to get a head-start and establish its name in the handheld console industry.

The battle was close with New York having hope, the tiniest of vision of pushing this series further. However, Miami was able to hold them off. After coming so close, there is no doubt, the Knicks will be upset. But for one of their stars, it is still one of the best and most important days of his life.</p> <p>The Knicks lost 92-96 in the season-ending Game 6 to the Miami Heat. <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/jimmy-butler/\">Jimmy Butler</a> and Co. will face the winner of the Boston Celtics-Philadelphia 76ers series who play a Game 7 tomorrow.</p> <h2>Knicks Star checked into Game 6 with a unique superpower?</h2> <p>For any Knicks player, there was one goal in mind, to beat the Heat. Nothing could waver them from that objective. Yet there was one guy who had his emotions go haywire before Game 6. Josh Hart, the former Lakers forward got a call hours before the game that he was going to be a first-time father. Without taking a second, he rushed into the car to get to his wife, Shannon Phillips.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the doctors gave him some shattering news. They weren&#8217;t sure if he could make it to see the birth of his twins. Hart had to make a call, and so he made a brave one. The 28-year-old went back to the team hotel in Miami and instantly got on a Zoom call to watch the pregnancy.</p> <p><strong>READ MORE-</strong><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-basketball-news-knicks-veteran-dismantles-michael-jordan-goat-debate-with-an-honest-lebron-james-question/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knicks Veteran Dismantles Michael Jordan GOAT Debate With an Honest LeBron James Question</a></p> <p>Hart would play in Game 6, but irrespective of the result, there was only one thing he wanted to do after the final buzzer.</p> <p><em>&#8220;No matter the result of this game, he has a car, he has a plane on standby.

The duo discussed Sunday&#8217;s race while Hamlin recalled a wholesome moment with his daughter after his first win of this year.</p> <h2>Puzzled Denny Hamlin recalls the conversation with his daughter after Kansas</h2> <p>After his much-needed win at the speedway, the veteran driver recalled a candid conversation with his daughter after the race that left him puzzled. Though the <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/23xi-racing/\">23Xl Racing</a> co-owner is the fiery driver inside the oval, he is also a loving father to his daughter.</p> <p>Getting reminders of his daughter&#8217;s favorite character, Dorothy, a fictional character based on the popular cartoon, &#8220;Wizard of the Oz,&#8221; Hamlin recalled the sweet conversation with his daughter after he clinched the Kansas trophy.</p> <p>Starting off the conversation, Hamlin quickly shared the wholesome moment, saying, <em>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So my daughter on Facetime says, Daddy, you won in my home state. I’m like, &#8216;What are you talking about?&#8217; She’s like, &#8216;I’m Dorothy.&#8217; I’m like, Oh that’s right, so yeah shout-out to Dorothy, winning in her home state.&#8221;</span></em></p> <p>As his co-host, Jared Allen said, <em>&#8220;</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>No place like home.&#8221;</em> Hamlin also resonated with the emotion as said,<em> &#8220;</em></span><em>No place like home and for me 4 times there, shoot feels like home that’s for sure.&#8221; </em></p> <p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/69F4VXkQc9Gx7bMBmODiPq?utm_source=generator&amp;t=149795\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p> <p>Further on during the conversation, the 42-year-old veteran discussed the recent happenings in NASCAR including Legacy Motor Club&#8217;s massive heel turn. However, it was clear that despite being an aggressive and feisty competitor on the track, he is also a loving father. The driver has also been open about his family time.</p> <p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/nascar-news-kyle-larsons-crew-chief-savagely-slams-denny-hamlin-with-a-seven-word-radio-message-go-on-and-wreck-us-hendrick-motorsports/\">Kyle Larson’s Crew Chief Savagely Slams Denny Hamlin With a 7-Word Radio Message- “Go On and Wreck Us”</a></strong></p> <h2>Looking back at Denny Hamlin&#8217;s special day with his daughter at the father-daughter dance</h2> <p>Besides being a fierce competitor and being busy as a co-owner of 23Xl Racing, Hamlin is also a proud father of two girls.

Hamlin also shared funny instances of his daughter, Molly, having fun with her friends while Hamlin was anxious and skeptical to shake a leg at the program.</p> <p>This could be one of the reasons why the JGR driver is seeing a rise in popularity.

It was <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/denny-hamlin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Denny Hamlin</a> who had earlier advocated this idea.  But again, it opens a floodgate of questions and controversies. And perhaps it will open the door to the dead past.

In the latest episode of the Door Bumper Clear podcast, co-host Freddie Kraft clearly gave his nod in the &#8220;Spot On Spot Off&#8221; segment.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A question that a fan asked was, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;NASCAR displayed the part in a question from the number 3 teams, post Martinsville in the hauler for teams to view. They also posted the pictures and explanations of the violations on the social team for fans to see.

But comes as a shocker for many, perhaps even Dale Earnhardt Jr. <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/nascar-news-i-dont-love-it-dale-earnhardt-jr-advocates-against-denny-hamlins-calls-for-good-old-days-of-transparency/amp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Junior thinks this initiative to be a silly move.</a> In a recent episode of The Dale Jr. Download podcast, he said, &#8220;</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you wanted to see it, you could walk up in the hauler and it’d be in there, on the counter,</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could go up there and say, ‘I heard you took such-and-such.

He exclaimed, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I’mma put my owner’s hat on and I’m going to the racetrack as an Xfinity Series owner, somebody got caught with something, NASCAR took it. I don’t need to see it. I don’t have this urge to take a look at it. I’m not as curious about what they did to those louvers as the general public or the race fan is.&#8221;</span></i></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, now the question that hovers is how teams react to it. Will it turn out to be beneficial as Denny Hamlin had suggested and protect teams from facing more arbitrary penalties or is it just a silly move?

Influencers are not just expected to compete against other influencers but also entertain the fans before, during, and after the fight. However, the fans are not pleased with how <strong>Deji</strong> is promoting his next fight.<a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-jake-pauls-boxing-coach-remains-honest-while-predicting-former-rival-dejis-fate-against-swarmz/\"><strong> The YouTuber-cum-boxer will fight Swarmz on the undercard of Misfits 007</strong> </a>which will take place on May 13th.</p> <p>Swarmz is a British singer, rapper, and entertainer. He fought and got defeated by his older brother, KSI. He will be looking to make amends after that loss by beating Deji. However, ahead of the fight, fans complained that Deji has gotten boring.</p> <h2>Deji gets accused of not promoting his fight against Swarmz</h2> <p>Deji got to face off against Swarmz. During the face-off, the interviewer asked him what is it like to be standing in front of his opponent just a few days prior to his bout. To which, he had a very brief response. He stated, <em>&#8220;Yea&#8221;</em>.</p> <p><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\"><strong>@HappyPunchPromo</strong> posted the snippet of the face-off with the caption, <em>&#8220;Deji has become a man of few words&#8221;</em></span></p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deji has become a man of few words <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f923.png\" alt=\"🤣\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f62d.png\" alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/i6C3mkU5s3\">pic.twitter.com/i6C3mkU5s3</a></p> <p>&mdash; Happy Punch (@HappyPunchPromo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HappyPunchPromo/status/1656346570034380803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p> <p>It is safe to say that the fans were not happy with his response.

He spent his fortune recklessly on 3 Bengal tigers priced at $60,000 each, bought some pretty e \n xpensive pigeons, and also wasted a good chunk of his money on luxurious cars. Well, he surely made a change later in his life as he grew older, but due to his image of being a spendthrift, Tyson&#8217;s most admirable quality got overshadowed.</p> <p>Not a lot of people know that &#8216;The Baddest Man on the Planet&#8217; is a charitable man. His altruistic nature has actually made a difference in the world multiple times and has helped thousands of people. One such instance is when he fought against <strong>Roy Jones Jr</strong> back in 2020, he donated most of his earnings of $10 million dollars to charity. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-all-you-need-to-know-about-mike-tysons-social-welfare-program/\">he also has his own charitable organization, Mike Tyson Cares Foundation</a>, which focuses on helping families that fall in the lower income category. It&#8217;s a way to give them a better life and make their situation more comfortable and sustainable.</p> <p>Recently, another good deed of Mike Tyson has come forth in front of the public as <strong>Criss Angel</strong> joined as a guest on <em>Hotboxin&#8217; with Mike Tyson</em> where he shared how Tyson has donated money to his Foundation multiple times for the cause of fighting against pediatric cancer.</p> <h2>Criss Angel is grateful for Mike Tyson&#8217;s help</h2> <p>At the very beginning of the episode, after the guest&#8217;s introduction was done, Angel started praising Tyson as a person and a boxer. He also shed some light on their relationship, on how Tyson would bring his kids to Angel&#8217;s shows all the time. He was honored to be friends with such a great personality and a <em>&#8220;wonderful human being&#8221;</em>. Criss also stated how a lot of people don&#8217;t really understand the soft side of Tyson.</p> <div class=\"flex-video widescreen youtube\" data-plyr-embed-id=\"mPiTKnaOziw\" data-plyr-provider=\"youtube\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Criss Angel, Magician | Hotboxin’ with Mike Tyson\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPiTKnaOziw?start=55&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>Then he revealed how Tyson has donated lump sums of money to patients with pediatric cancer. Angel said, <em>&#8220;You have donated so much money to pediatric cancer, to my Foundation and I just want to say as a friend and as a person with the kid that went through it, thank you so much.&#8221;</em></p> <p>Angel also got a bit choked up with  emotions as the past few years have been a bit hard on him as a father. But now everything is much better because his son is currently in remission for more than a year now.</p> <p><strong>Watch This Story: <a class=\"jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9\" href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/stories/boxing-news-youngest-boxing-champions-in-history-mike-tyson-wilfred-benitez-and-more/\">Youngest Boxing Champions in History: Mike Tyson, Wilfred Benitez, and More</a></strong></p> <h2>Criss Angel gives good news to the world</h2> <p>In 2015, Criss Angel went through a difficult challenge when his son was diagnosed with B-Cell A.L.L. Leukemia. He had to undergo chemotherapy treatments to get rid of the cancer. Being deeply affected by this experience, Criss Angel founded a charitable organization named Jonny Christopher Children&#8217;s Charitable Foundation. It is now 2022 and he has announced that his son is in remission. There has been no indication of cancer returning, which is great news for their family.</p> <div class=\"flex-video widescreen youtube\" data-plyr-embed-id=\"Rzad6l3d8ww\" data-plyr-provider=\"youtube\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POST I HAVE EVER MADE\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rzad6l3d8ww?start=191&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> <p>As a proud dad, Angel recently posted a 14-minute documentary on his Official YouTube channel titled &#8220;1095,&#8221; which showcased his son&#8217;s struggles.

              "\n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/mike-tyson/\">Mike Tyson</a></strong> is undoubtedly one of the most popular professional boxers there has ever been in the sport. The former heavyweight is considered to be one of the best boxers ever to tighten their gloves. And it can be conspicuously seen in his old fights. But, apart from knocking his opponents out cold, the former champion developed other interests very early on. Tyson has had a long-time affinity towards pigeons since childhood. So much so that he once beat up a man for killing one of his pigeons when he was just a child.</p> <p>However, in a recent episode of his podcast, the champ opened up about the other side of loving pigeons and how sometimes he just had to let them go.</p> <h2>Mike Tyson on his pigeons getting lost</h2> <p>In a recent episode of Hotboxin&#8217; with Mike Tyson, the 56-year-old was joined by Magician and entertainer Criss Angel. The two shared their love for pigeons and even talked about how they train their pigeons to perform certain tasks.  Angel was in awe of Tyson&#8217;s work with pigeons and how he makes them do various activities.</p> <p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-mike-tyson-inadvertently-reveals-why-you-shouldnt-buy-pigeons-from-him/\">Mike Tyson Inadvertently Reveals Why You Shouldn’t Buy Pigeons From Him</a></p> <p>Angel said<em>, &#8220;What he does with his pigeons is so remarkable. Because they have these pigeons and they race them. And, they can have these pigeons go to a specific part.&#8221; </em>He further shared his own example claiming that he could only make the pigeons go to a specific part within the same building. And when Tyson was asked about how far the pigeons can travel. He gave a startling response and said, <em>&#8220;a thousand miles.&#8221;</em></p> <p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPiTKnaOziw?start=308\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p> <p>Tyson also revealed that he starts training the pigeon as soon as they hatch from their eggs. But then Angel had an interesting question and asked how many pigeons did Tyson &#8220;lose along the way&#8221; when he &#8220;let them go&#8221; . To which Tyson replied, <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a big percentage. It depends on the ferocity of the predator. Sometimes they get lost.&#8221;</em></p> <h2>How much does Mike Tyson love his pigeons?</h2> <p>&#8216;Iron Mike&#8217; has an undying love for pigeons. And, as we know, Tyson does not care about money when it comes to things he loves. According to certain reports, he once spent <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-how-much-are-mike-tysons-pigeons-worth/\">over $400,000 on his pigeons.</a></p> <figure id=\"attachment_435510\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-435510\" style=\"width: 1920px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-435510\" src=\"https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Tyson with Pigeons\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1322\" srcset=\"https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-457x315.jpg 457w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-218x150.jpg 218w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-768x529.jpg 768w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-1536x1058.jpg 1536w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-370x255.jpg 370w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-800x551.jpg 800w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-185x127.jpg 185w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-740x510.jpg 740w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-20x14.jpg 20w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-400x275.jpg 400w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-1600x1102.jpg 1600w, https://www.staging.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-56223182-1-70x48.jpg 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-435510\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WALSALL, UNITED KINGDOM &#8211; NOVEMBER 18: Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson meets up with a pigeon fancier Horace Potts (L), of Bloxwich, Walsall, West Midlands on November 18, 2005 in Walsall, England.

Its makers have got an amazing approach of collaborating with renowned entities. As a result, many fan favorite \n characters, from pop culture and real life, have made their way into the battle royale over the last few years, including streamers. Names like SypherPK, Loserfruit, LazarBeam, and Ninja have got their own playable avatars in Epic Games&#8217; free-to-play blockbuster. But now, the makers of Call of Duty have also decided to use this formula in their ongoing entry <a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modern Warfare II</a>.</p> <p>In case anyone missed keeping track of events, Activision had recently unveiled surprising bundles featuring two fan-favorite streamers. Both of them will soon arrive in Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2, with their own playable Operators. Well these two personalities are none other than TimTheTatman and Nickmercs.</p> <h2>Will Call of Duty continue bringing more bundles themed on gaming streamers similar to Fortnite?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/esports-news-call-of-duty-streamers-celebrate-timthetatmans-epic-warzone-two-modern-warfare-ii-debut-in-season-three-reloaded/\">TimTheTatman had recently announced his collaboration</a> with Modern Warfare II. His fans will be able to acquire a playable Operator, directly based on their favorite content creator, later this month.

              "\n <p><a href=\"https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/the-undertaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The</strong> <strong>Undertaker</strong></a> dominated the squared circle for a long time. During all these years, there haven&#8217;t been many complaints about the wrestling star. However, an old opponent of The Phenom has recently raised his voice against him. <strong>Koko B. Ware</strong> recently tweeted while sharing a picture of him with The Undertaker during in-ring action.</p> <p>The Hall of Famer wrote a hilarious caption over the picture. In the caption, he claimed that he was comparatively taller until the day Taker performed his finisher on him. The story, the picture, and the caption all add up to be a hilarious internet moment.</p> <h2>The Undertaker cost &#8216;Birdman&#8217; his height</h2> <p>One of the most highlighted qualities of Koko B. Ware was the theme song that he sang for himself. While several wrestlers have a custom song, not all of them have sung it for themselves like &#8216;Birdman&#8217;. Apart from this, another key event in his career was enduring The Undertaker&#8217;s Tombstone Piledriver for the first time. Koko recently used this highlight recently to target Taker in a hilarious fashion.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I was 6’ 3” before this Tombstone.
